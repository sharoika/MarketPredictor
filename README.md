# Project Description 
## Application Function
This application was made and designed to predict whether a specific stock will go up or down for that given day. The process starts by running the tweet scraper, which will give us all the current tweets on the specific stock. Next we run it through the sentiment analyzer, which will give an output of if the tweets are positive or negative, giving a range from "-1" to "1", symbolizing a positive, neutral, or negative sentiment. Then we run the finance scraper, which will give us an output of the performance of the stock.
